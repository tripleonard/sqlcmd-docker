This is the driver and utilities of the Microsoft® ODBC Driver 13 (Preview) for SQL Server®.  The following files are included:

install.sh - The installation script to run to install the driver and its
utilities.

build_dm.sh - A helpful script used to download, configure and
build the correct version of the unixODBC Driver Manager if needed.

README - this file.

LICENSE - the license agreement for this product. Used by install.sh.

WARNING - Microsoft's 3rd party liability disclaimer.  Displayed when the
build_dm.sh script is run.

INSTALL - Installation instructions for the driver.

bin/bcp-13.0.0.0 - Bulk Copy Program.  Used to import and export data
from a SQL Server table.

bin/bcp.rll - resource library that contains strings for error messages
used by BCP.  Currently only in US English (en_US).

bin/sqlcmd-13.0.0.0 - Run SQL statements on a server.  Can be used
interactively.

bin/SQLCMD.rll - resource library that contains strings for error messages
used by sqlcmd.  Currently only in US English (en_US).

bin/BatchParserGrammar.dfa - file used by sqlcmd

bin/BatchParserGrammar.llr - file used by sqlcmd

docs/en_US.tar.gz - HTML documentation for 
the driver and its associated utilities.

lib64/libmsodbcsql-13.0.so.0.0 - the driver

lib64/msodbcsqlr13.rll - resource library that contains strings for error
messages used by the driver. Currently only in US English (en_US).

Prerequisites for Installing
============================

This driver is only supported on 64-bit Linux. 
Other configurations are not supported and will not likely work.

The following libraries must be installed for the driver to work:
  RedHat 7
   glibc
   e2fsprogs
   krb5-libs
   openssl
  SUSE 12
   glibc 
   libuuid1 
   krb5 
   openssl       
  UBUNTU 15.04
   libc6 
   libkrb5-3 
   libgss3 
   e2fsprogs 
   openssl

Most likely these libraries are installed, as they should come installed by 
default on the supported versions of Linux.

The installing user must have write privileges to the /opt directory by
default.  Otherwise, directories to place the driver and utilities may be
specified with the --bin-dir and --lib-dir options of install.sh.

This driver requires the unixODBC Driver Manager 2.3.1.  The driver manager
must be configured with the following encoding options (other options may 
also apply):

./configure --enable-iconv --with-iconv-char-enc=UTF8
  --with-iconv-ucode-enc=UTF16LE

In addition, `odbc_config --cflags` must return -DSIZEOF_LONG_INT=8 and
must NOT return -DBUILD_LEGACY_64_BIT_MODE.

Also, the installing user must have write permissions to the /usr/bin
directory if the abbreviated symbolic links to bcp-13.0.0.0 (bcp) and
sqlcmd-13.0.0.0 (sqlcmd) are to be installed.  Otherwise, use --force to
skip this step.

The installation script can verify most of these configuration
prerequisites by running:

./install.sh verify


What If The Driver Manager Isn't Configured Properly?
-----------------------------------------------------

You may build a properly configured unixODBC Driver Manager using the
build_dm.sh script included.  However, if this script is unable to
complete, you may configure and build the proper driver manager yourself
using the instructions in INSTALL.

Installing
==========

To install the driver once the prerequisites are assured, simply run the
installation script as follows:

./install.sh install

Options for the installation are:
  --bin-dir=<directory> - location to deposit bcp and sqlcmd utilities,
      defaults to the /opt/microsoft/sqlncli/bin directory
  --lib-dir=<directory> - location to deposit the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC 
      Driver for Linux, defaults to the /opt/microsoft/sqlncli/lib directory
  --force - continues installation even if an error occurs
  --accept-license - forgoes showing the EULA and implies agreement with its 
                     contents

A successful installation will complete as follows:

Checking for 64 bit Linux compatible OS ..................................... OK
Checking required libs are installed ........................................ OK
unixODBC utilities (odbc_config and odbcinst) installed ..................... OK
unixODBC Driver Manager version 2.3.1 installed ............................. OK
unixODBC Driver Manager configuration correct .............................. OK*
Microsoft® ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server® already installed .......... NOT FOUND
Microsoft® ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server® files copied ...................... OK
Symbolic links for bcp and sqlcmd created ................................... OK
Microsoft® ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server® registered ................. INSTALLED

Any problems are reported in the log file, the path to which is printed at
the end of the installation.


Why is there an * in the configuration output?
----------------------------------------------

The installation script will attempt to verify the configuration of the
system before installing the driver.  However, the character encoding used by
the unixODBC Driver Manager cannot be verified through its included utilities.
If you are not sure of the encoding that the unixODBC 2.3.1 Driver Manager was
built with, check with your system administrator.  If the encoding still cannot
be verified, you might need to build and install a new copy.  See 'What If The
Driver Manager Isn't Configured Properly?' above.

Known Issues
============
Always Encrypted is supported only by Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 (Preview) for SQL Server with SQL Server 2016 (Preview 3.4+). This preview release does not support the following:
•	Bulk Operations via BCP or ODBC bulk functions
•	Locales other than EN-US
